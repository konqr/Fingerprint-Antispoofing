# Fingerprint Antispoofing

Bachelor's Thesis Project under [Dr. Kannan Karthik](http://www.iitg.ac.in/engfac/k.karthik/), Associate Professor, IITG

Abstract: Fingerprinting has been one of the most significant pillars of biometric identification for close
to a century. Spoof fingerprints are one of the most prominent ways to attack the security of a
fingerprint detection and recognition system. We develop an analysis technique for detecting
the liveness of a fingerprint sample. The development of a novel unique feature space for a live
fingerprint is undertaken with the motivation of using it as a distinguishing metric against the
feature space of the spoof fingerprints.
